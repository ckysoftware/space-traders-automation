# Automation for SpaceTraders

## Description

SpaceTraders is an API-based game where you acquire and manage a fleet of ships to explore, trade, and fight your way across the galaxy. Use any programming language with our API to control the most powerful fleet in universe. (Quoted from <https://spacetraders.io>)

This repository aims to automate all the ships for PROFIT!!!!!. It is written in C++ just because I want to practice C++.

NOTE: This is a work in progress. The code is not yet complete.

## Current Status

- Automation for cycle: Mine -> Sell -> Deliver Contract
